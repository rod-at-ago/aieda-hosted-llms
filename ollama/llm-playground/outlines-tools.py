    Guidelines which MUST be followed:
    Rule 1: Always select one or more of the above tools based on the user query
    Rule 2: It is possible that there is no tool that match the user request. In that case, just respond with the following JSON without adding any Notes or Explanation otherwise my kittens will be killed:
    []

    Rule 3: If a tool is found, you must respond in the JSON format matching the following schema:
    {{ response_model | schema }}

    Rule 4: If there are multiple tools required, make sure a list of tools are returned in a JSON array.
    Rule 5: Do not add any additional Notes or Explanations
